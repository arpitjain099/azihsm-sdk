//! Partition management types and traits.
//!
//! Defines the [`HsmPartitionManager`] trait used by core to query
//! and mutate per-partition state.  Each partition is a host-facing
//! controller interface identified by [`HsmPartId`]; the firmware
//! supports up to `HSM_NUM_PARTITIONS` of them, addressed implicitly
//! through the [`HsmIo`] handle (`io.pid()`).
//!
//! ## Per-partition state
//!
//! Each partition slot owns:
//!
//! - A [`PartState`] lifecycle field.
//! - A resource count (number of host-allocated SQ/CQ pairs).
//! - An opaque identity blob ([`PartId`]) and an ECC-P384 identity
//!   key pair.
//! - A pair of crypto material slots used during credential
//!   establishment and session setup:
//!   - **establish-cred** — one-time RSA-OAEP keypair used to receive
//!     the host's bootstrap credential. Cleared after use.
//!   - **session-enc** — long-lived ECDH key used to derive
//!     per-session encryption keys.
//! - A 32-byte randomness nonce, refreshed per credential / session
//!   event.
//! - An optional sealed BK3 blob (set once, ≤ 1024 bytes).
//! - An optional masked BK_BOOT blob (set once, written by `InitBk3`).
//! - A platform-specific VM launch GUID binding used by `InitBk3`.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! Unallocated ── allocate resources + identity ──▶ Allocated
//!                                                      │
//!                          generate internal keys + nonce
//!                                                      ▼
//!                                                  Enabled ──▶ Disabled
//!                                                                │
//!                                              re-enable internal keys
//!                                                                │
//!                                                                ▼
//!                                                            Enabled
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implicit partition addressing
//!
//! All trait methods take an [`HsmIo`] handle rather than an explicit
//! [`HsmPartId`].  The partition is resolved via [`HsmIo::pid`].  This
//! prevents accidental cross-partition queries and keeps the trait
//! shape uniform with the rest of the PAL.
